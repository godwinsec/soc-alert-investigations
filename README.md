This repository documents Tier-1 Security Operations Center (SOC) alert investigations performed in a simulated Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) environment. The investigations focus on real-world alert triage, evidence collection, and incident analysis using Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Entra ID Protection, and Splunk. Each case follows a structured SOC workflow, including alert scoping, contextual analysis based on client-specific constraints, and risk assessment supported by observable evidence. The scenarios emulate multi-client MSSP operations, requiring proper tool selection, process adherence, and escalation discipline. Investigations demonstrate handling of identity-based threats such as atypical travel, unfamiliar sign-in properties, credential misuse etc. Emphasis is placed on distinguishing benign activity from malicious behavior using business context, telemetry validation, and threat indicators. All reports include analyst reasoning, findings, and recommended actions aligned with Tier-1 SOC responsibilities. This portfolio is intended to showcase practical SOC skills, analytical thinking, and professional incident documentation.
