# SOC Tier-1 Alert Investigation Portfolio

This repository documents **Tier-1 Security Operations Center (SOC) alert investigations** conducted in a simulated **Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)** environment, as part of hands-on SOC industrial training aligned with real-world operational workflows.

The portfolio contains multiple **incident case studies** representing alerts typically handled by a Tier-1 SOC analyst, with a focus on **alert triage, evidence collection, contextual analysis, and escalation decision-making**.

Investigations leverage a diverse set of **enterprise, open-source, and investigative SOC tools**, including endpoint and identity protection platforms (e.g., Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Entra ID Protection), SIEM and log analysis platforms (e.g., Splunk), **email security and email analysis tools** for phishing and mail-based threats, **OSINT and threat intelligence sources** for enrichment and attribution, and the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** to structure analysis and support consistent threat classification across incidents.

## SOC Investigation Workflow

Each case follows a structured SOC workflow:

- Alert scoping and initial validation  
- Contextual analysis based on client-specific constraints  
- Evidence collection and telemetry correlation  
- Risk assessment supported by observable indicators  
- Clear documentation of findings and recommended actions  

---

## Operational Context

The scenarios emulate **multi-client MSSP operations**, requiring disciplined tool usage, adherence to process, and appropriate escalation judgment.

Investigations primarily cover **identity-based threats**, including atypical travel, unfamiliar sign-in properties, potential credential misuse and so on, with emphasis on distinguishing benign activity from malicious behavior using **business context** and **telemetry validation**.

## Portfolio Purpose

Each report includes documented analytical reasoning, investigation results, and recommended next steps based on Tier-1 SOC workflows.

This repository serves as a record of my hands-on SOC investigations and how I approach alert triage, analysis, and incident documentation during training.
